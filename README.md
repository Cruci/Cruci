- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cruci
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, coding, dogs and cats and tech stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS/TS, React/Angular & and the vast bottomless ocean of game development with Unity.

- On my TODO-list, when I have energy after full-time employment, is to get around basics of Dart/Flutter in Android App development.
- I like to code frontend and backend.
- I have basic experience in databases. Main usage is through ORMs and migrations.
- I aspire to learn game development with Unity.
